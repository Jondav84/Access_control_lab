# ProjectX_policy_first — docs/api Directory Construction Transcript
# Model: Reference Architecture (Policy-First)
# Scope: Publish-only documentation for api_team
# Purpose: Provide read-only access to published documentation for teams and
#          reviewers while reserving all write/publish authority to project_lead.
#          Testers are explicitly excluded.

## 1) Directory Creation (policy owner identity)
############################################################

# Command(s) used:
#   sudo -u project_lead mkdir -p ProjectX_policy_first/docs/api

# Result (ls -ld):
#   drwxr-s---+ 2 project_lead emp_admin 4096 <date> ProjectX_policy_first/docs/api/

# Notes:
# - Directory is created as project_lead under the docs/ policy boundary.
# - Group emp_admin is inherited automatically due to setgid on docs/.
# - Access and default ACLs are inherited from docs/ without modification.
# - No ownership or group normalization occurs or is required at this level.
# - docs/api is not team-owned; it is a publish-only namespace.
# - All write authority remains exclusively with project_lead.
# - Teams and reviewers receive read/traverse access via inherited ACLs.
# - Testers have no access via inherited access or default ACL policy.
